# Turtle-Graphics
A circular graphics project is created using turtle module.
Turtle graphics provides a representation of a physical “turtle” (a little robot with a pen) that draws on a sheet of paper on the floor. It's an effective and well-proven way for learners to encounter programming concepts and interaction with software, as it provides instant, visible feedback.
